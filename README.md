# ApiConsumer
First project is about comicbooks, catches API and you can go from one picture (comic) to next and also previous.
You can provide actual comic number (1-1500) or it goes directlly to latest one if you dont provide any number.

2nd project is about sunrise/sunset for your specific location.
API accepts your coordinates and based on that it gives you exact time of sunrise/sunset for your location.
